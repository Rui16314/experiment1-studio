<p>You will play 10 rounds of a first‑price sealed‑bid auction. Each round you are randomly matched with an opponent.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your valuation is drawn uniformly from 0 to 100 (two decimals).</li>
  <li>You have 60 seconds to submit a bid between 0 and 100.</li>
  <li>Highest bid wins and pays their own bid (first‑price). Ties are broken at random.</li>
  <li>Payoff if you win: valuation − price; otherwise 0.</li>
</ul>
